                <h2>Here’s a little bit about me:</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m a born-and-bred South African with a journey as colourful as
                    the country itself. I started off in the heart of Cape Town,
                    soaked up the energy of Johannesburg during my childhood, and now
                    I've made my way back to the Mother City for round two. Let me
                    tell you, the beauty here is genuinely irresistible – the Mountain
                    views, the ocean breeze, and yes, even the unpredictable
                    weather. I adore rainy days, but these winters are a whole
                    new level of wet. I’m still in the process of figuring out how to enjoy
                    them without turning into a human prune and getting laundry done. </p>

                <p>Academically, I’ve always been a bit of a geek. I trained as an
                    electronics technician, diving into the nuts and bolts of the tech
                    world. In 2022, I leveled up with a degree in Information
                    Management – yep, I’m all about that data life. Now, I’m channeling my techy background and love for
                    innovation into the
                    renewable energy sector as a junior project manager. It's
                    thrilling to be part of an industry that's shaping the future and
                    saving the planet one solar panel at a time.</p>

                <p>So, whether I’m chasing the sun or dancing in the rain, I’m all about embracing
                    the journey and making the most of every moment here in the Cape.</p>
